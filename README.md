# WPF DataGrid Performance - Asynchronous Scrolling

DataGrid offers asynchronous scrolling mode to update the binding of rows asynchronously without affecting the UI during load and scroll operations. Asynchronous scrolling can be enabled by setting [ScrollMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/wpf/Syncfusion.SfGrid.WPF~Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Grid.SfDataGrid~ScrollMode.html) as `Async`. When enabling asynchronous scrolling the rendering will be visible to user like fade animation.
